# mkv-sub-extractor
A small tool to extract subtitles from mkv containers

## Usage
```
python3 mkv-sub-extractor.py file.mkv
```

## Notes
It is a premature version of the tool, only implemented SubRip/SRT extractions.  
Need mkvmerge and mkvextract from [MKVToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download "MKVToolNix") to be installed.
